# Zomato Vulnerability Monitoring Dashboard

This document provides instructions on how to access and use the real-time vulnerability monitoring dashboard.

## Setup Requirements

Before using the vulnerability monitor, you need to set up OWASP ZAP:

1. **Install OWASP ZAP**:
   - Download from: https://www.zaproxy.org/download/
   - Install on your system

2. **Start ZAP in Daemon Mode**:
   - **Windows**: Run the `start_zap.bat` script
   - **Mac/Linux**: Run the `start_zap.sh` script (make it executable first with `chmod +x start_zap.sh`)
   - Keep the terminal/command window open while using the vulnerability scanner
   - The scripts automatically set the API key to "zap123"

3. **Verify ZAP is Running**:
   - Once ZAP is started, it should be accessible at http://localhost:8080/
   - The API key "zap123" has been configured in the startup script

## Accessing the Dashboard

1. **Login as Admin**:
   - Navigate to http://localhost:5000/login
   - Login with admin credentials:
     - Username: `admin`
     - Password: `admin123`

2. **Access the Dashboard**:
   - There are three ways to access the dashboard:
     - From the main navigation menu, click on "Vulnerability Monitor"
     - From the Admin Panel, click on the "Live Vulnerability Monitor" button
     - Directly access the URL: http://localhost:5000/security/monitor

## Using the Vulnerability Monitoring Dashboard

### 1. Starting a Scan

1. **Select Target**: Choose which part of the application to scan from the target list:
   - Local Application (all pages)
   - Login Page (focused scan on the login functionality)
   - Admin Panel
   - User API
   - Orders API

2. **Start the Scan**: Click the green "Start Scan" button to begin the vulnerability detection process.

3. **Monitoring Progress**: The scan will run through multiple phases:
   - Connecting to ZAP
   - Passive scanning
   - Spider scanning (discovering pages)
   - AJAX scanning
   - Active scanning (testing for vulnerabilities)
   
   The progress bar will update to show completion percentage.

### 2. Viewing Real-Time Results

During the scan, the dashboard provides real-time updates:

- **Live Log Window**: Shows step-by-step details of what's happening
- **Vulnerability Counters**: Display the number of issues found by severity level
- **Discovered Endpoints**: List of application pages/endpoints found during the scan
- **Vulnerability Details**: When a vulnerability is found, detailed information appears including:
  - Description of the vulnerability
  - Evidence showing why it was detected
  - Recommended solution
  - CWE ID and references

### 3. Managing Logs

- **Clear Logs**: Remove all current log entries
- **Download Logs**: Save the complete scan log to a text file for documentation

### 4. Stopping a Scan

- Click the red "Stop Scan" button to halt a running scan
- Note that partial results will still be available

## Understanding Vulnerabilities

The dashboard categorizes vulnerabilities by risk level:

- **High Risk** (Red): Critical issues that require immediate attention
- **Medium Risk** (Orange): Significant issues that should be addressed
- **Low Risk** (Yellow): Minor issues to fix when possible
- **Informational** (Blue): Not direct vulnerabilities but useful security information

Each vulnerability detail includes:
- The affected URL
- Description of the vulnerability
- Evidence of the vulnerability in your code
- Recommended solution to fix the issue

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **ZAP Connection Failed**: Ensure ZAP is running in daemon mode with the API key set
2. **No Results Showing**: Check that you're logged in as admin and have appropriate permissions
3. **Scan Not Starting**: Verify that no other scan is already in progress
